# Generalized-Nash-Equilibrium-Solvers
This repository contains two Generalized Nash Equilibrium Solvers - One Stochastic Gradient Descent, and one Evolutionary-Inspired Algorithm
The solvers were created using Jupyter Notebook and Google Colaboratory, and were written in Python. 
These solvers were investigated in their ability and limitations, and discussed in my Master's Thesis, published by the University of Guelph. Please feel free to reach out to
me directly for details or a copy of the thesis at roie.fields@gmail.com
